# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of school district analysis
### Background
The school board has claimed that the scores in the students_complete.csv file look as though they have been altered. 
#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was is to verify any academic integrity. We can look at the data in a single dataframe with pandas built in package in python. This allows for the comparison of the math & reading scores from Thomas High School with the other High Schools in the dataset to find if there was academic dishonesty with the scores reported from Thomas High School for the ninth graders. The reason to find this is to uphold the state testing standards. 
We were able to obtain the values of test scores for each grade in each school to see the result difference when Thomas High School 9th graders' math and reading scores were negated from the data set. This will help us verify the academic dihonesty that is suspected.
